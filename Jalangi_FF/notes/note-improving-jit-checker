tasks:
1. use set for storing polymorphic statements, use the field of an object.
2. add a count to prioritize all warnings
	for polymorphic statements, first choose the two most frequent used signatures, and use the count of the less frequent one as the weight.
3. modify the checker for numeric/non-numeric type thing
4. add new abstractions (DSL) to facilitate easy analysis development
